# Instructions

This assignment is just about GitHub data management. The goal is to give you a chance to practice wrangling and tidying data. We do this very early in the class because soon (**next week**) we will start doing some empirical analysis using real data. The sooner you are comfortable with the datasets, the better.

Please turn in your empirical work as an `R Markdown` document. If you are not familiar with `R Markdown`, take a look at the following resources:

- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
- [Using R Markdown for Class Reports](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/)

If you're still new to `R Markdown`, then there will be some growing pains. Please be patient with yourself and stick to it. One of the goals of the course is to develop good workflow habits. This means doing work in a way that minimizes mistakes and maximizes reproducability. `R Markdown` exists exactly for these reasons. It allows you to keep your data analysis and the description of that analysis together in a single document or group of documents. It's really easy to introduce mistakes when copying and pasting empirical results into a text document, and it's even easier to waste hours (*days/weeks?*) re-pasting results into your text document and re-writing the results accordingly. Doing everything in `R Markdown` avoids all of these issues. In the long run, it's much more efficient.

You can submit your answers as an html document in your personal GitHub repo. Please also adopt the naming convention, *'last name'-'first initial'-hwk1.html*. For example, in my case this would be *McCarthy-I-hwk1*. In addition to your answers, please be sure to include the `R` code that generated your answers. Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.


# Using *Git* and *GitHub*

The first part of the assignment is to confirm you're good with *Git* and *GitHub*. 

1. Log in to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). It's free if you sign in through Emory, then you can link to your personal LinkedIn account. 

2. Take the [Learning GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github?u=2149178) course. It takes a couple of hours to complete. Once it's completed, you'll get a certificate added to your LinkedIn profile. 

3. Take a screenshot of your profile page showing you completed the course and add the screenshot to your `R Markdown` document. Hint: to add a screenshot in the document, you can do something like: `![](D:/pictures/screenshot.png)`


# Building the data
Now let's do some data work. The purpose of this part of the assignment is essentially to practice database management. Most of your professional lives will likely involve managing data. It can be tedious but also extremely rewarding when you finally get to find out what's going on in the analysis stage. Anyway, let's get to work! All of these questions require you to use the [Medicare Advantage GitHub Repo](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage).


## Enrollment Data
Run the `R` code to organize the **Monthly Plan Enrollment Data**. Once you've created your final dataset (it's called *full_ma_data* in my code), answer the following:

1. How many observations exist in your current dataset? 
2. How many different *plan_types* exist in the data?
3. Provide a table of the count of plans under each plan type in each year. Your table should look something like Table \@ref(tab:plancount).

```{r, include=F}
test.data <- matrix(round(runif(15,10,50),0),nrow=3, ncol=5)
row.names(test.data) <- c("Type 1", "Type 2", "Type 3")
```

```{r plancount, include=T, eval=T}
knitr::kable(test.data, col.names=c("2010","2011","2012","2013","2014"),
             type="html", caption = "Plan Count by Year", booktabs = TRUE)
```
