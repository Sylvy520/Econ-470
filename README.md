# Econ 470/HLTH 470: Research in Health Economics

This is the capstone course for the joint major in Economics and Human Health, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthy-econ.com) at Emory University. 

Before going much further, please be sure to read the [syllabus](https://github.com/imccart/Econ-470/blob/master/Econ 470 Syllabus.pdf). This will give you a sense of what to expect in the course as well as details of specific assignments and projects. Below are the lecture notes and underlying code files for the class. This is very much a work in progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. Better yet, you can clone the repo via Git and then pull regularly to get updates. Please take a look at [these slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html) if you are unfamiliar with Git or are unsure how to do any of that. We'll also do this very early in class.
