# Econ 470/HLTH 470: Research in Health Economics

This is the capstone course for the joint major in Economics and Human Health, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. 

Before going much further, please be sure to read the [syllabus](Syllabus/Econ470-Syllabus.pdf). This provides a sense of what to expect in the course as well as details of specific assignments and projects. Below are the lecture notes and underlying code files for the class. This is very much a work in progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. Better yet, you can clone the repo via *Git* and then pull regularly to get updates. Please take a look at [these slides](01-Introduction/01-Introduction.html) for some pointers on installing and working with Git(Hub). We'll also do this very soon together.


## Notes and Slides
Below are all of the slides that I'll use throughout the class. The slides will open as html files. Note that I've disabled "touch" navigation, which means that it's not possible to advance the slides with a touchscreen. I did this because I will record the screen in each class, and I'll annotate the slides throughout the class. If you want to see the slides in standard presentation format, you will need to access everything on a desktop or laptop rather than a phone or tablet. Everything is still accessible on a mobile platform, you just need to enable "simplified" view (or reader view in some browsers). I've provided a link for that view in each section. The simplified view will remove the slide/presentation formatting and allow you just to see the whole content as one big website. Some content won't display in the same way, but the content itself will be there.

1. Introduction: Motivation and software setup, [slides](01-Introduction/01-slides.html) and [simplified view](01-Introduction/01-simple.html)

2. Struggling with data, [slides](02-DataStruggles/02-slides.html) and [simplified view](02-DataStruggles/02-simple.html)

3. Selection on Observables and Hospital Pricing, [slides](03-Selection-HospitalPricing/03-slides.html) and [simplified view](03-Selection-HospitalPricing/03-simple.html)

## Acknowledgements
This class (and in particular the *R Markdown* formatting and animations) have benefitted significantly from several people who have been generous enough to make their website and other programs available to the public. Some of those people include:

1. [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) at the University of Oregon. His *GitHub* repository for [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) offers a wealth of information.

2. [Nick Huntington-Klein](http://nickchk.com/) at CSU Fullerton. His causal inference animations are hugely helpful, in addition to the notes for his causal inference class. All of this information is available at his website.

3. [Adam Sacarny](http://sacarny.com/) at Columbia University. He has some great hospital data made available through several *GitHub* respositories, this includes repositories for [HCRIS Data](https://github.com/asacarny/hospital-cost-reports) and [Provider of Services Data](https://github.com/asacarny/provider-of-services).

4. [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) has some incredible resources for people learning *R* and *GitHub*. Her and Jim Hester's [Happy Git and GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference.
